## 🚀 Microservice Architecture for Insurance


### 🧐 Proper order of pull requests and testing
- Create a new branch for a feature.
  - Implement feature.
  - Test feature branch.
  - Create a pull request onto develop branch.
- Merge pull request to Develop Branch.
   - Confirm that everything works.
   - Merge develop into master.
 
<p>That way, the blocking pipe is the feature branch - and since you can have as many as you want it's not a bottleneck.</p>
